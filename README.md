SQL let us perform deeper querying of the data, adding specific insights to what we found in Excel.

*Revenue by Product Category: SQL queries provided specific revenue insights for each product category, guiding strategic product planning.
*Top-Selling Products and Key Accounts: SQL identified the products with the highest sales value and top customers by total purchase, crucial for prioritizing resources.
*Quarterly Sales and Low-Selling Products: Analyzed sales trends by quarter and identified products without sales, supporting product lineup adjustments.
